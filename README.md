# **Anime Face Generator using PyTorch**

This project demonstrates the generation of high-quality anime faces using **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** built with PyTorch. The model is trained on a dataset of anime faces to create new, realistic anime-style facial images.

---

## **Features**
- Generates unique anime-style faces from random noise.
- Built using **PyTorch**, leveraging the power of deep learning.
- Implements state-of-the-art GAN architecture for high-quality outputs.
- Includes options for customizable training and visualization of results.

---

## **Requirements**
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.12+
- torchvision
- numpy
- matplotlib
- tqdm

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anime-face-generator.git
cd anime-face-generator
```

### **2. Dataset Preparation**
Download an anime face dataset (e.g., **Danbooru2019** or **Anime Face Dataset**) and place it in the `data/` folder. Update the `config.json` file with the dataset path.

### **3. Train the Model**
Run the following command to start training:
```bash
python train.py
```

Training parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs can be adjusted in the `config.json` file.

### **4. Generate Anime Faces**
Once training is complete, use the trained model to generate anime faces:
```bash
python generate.py
```
Generated images will be saved in the `outputs/` folder.

---

## **Architecture**
This project uses a **DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN)** architecture:
- **Generator**: Creates anime faces from random noise (latent space).  
- **Discriminator**: Distinguishes between real and fake anime faces, improving generator performance.

---

## **Results**
Generated anime faces will be saved as images in the `outputs/` directory. You can also visualize the training progress using TensorBoard:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir=runs
```

---

## **Future Improvements**
- Implement **StyleGAN** for even higher-quality outputs.
- Add support for conditional GANs to control face features (e.g., hair color, eye shape).
- Extend to video-based anime character generation.
